# Amazon Product Recommendation

A product recommendation model is a machine learning or data-driven system designed to provide recommendations to users based on their preferences, behaviours, or past interactions with products or content. These models are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, online streaming, news websites, and more, to help users discover relevant items or content.

Product recommendation Models are important to businesses for several reasons:

`Increased Sales and Revenue`
> Recommendation models can significantly boost sales and revenue by suggesting relevant products to customers. When customers see items they are more likely to purchase, it can lead to higher conversion rates and larger order values.

`Cross-Selling and Upselling`
> Recommendation models can suggest complementary or higher-priced items to customers, increasing the chances of cross-selling and upselling. For example, suggesting accessories for a purchased product or a premium version of a product can drive additional revenue.

`Enhanced Customer Experience`
> Recommending products that align with customers' interests and preferences can greatly improve the shopping experience. It helps customers find what they are looking for quickly and easily, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

`Inventory Management`
> By promoting products that may not sell well or need to be cleared from the inventory, businesses can better manage their stock and reduce the risk of overstocking or understocking.

`Reduced Decision Fatigue`
> In today's world of information overload, customers are often overwhelmed by choices. Recommendation models simplify decision-making by narrowing down options and reducing the cognitive load on customers.

`Marketing Efficiency`
> Recommendation models can optimize marketing efforts by targeting customers with products they are more likely to be interested in. This increases the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

*In this project I will first do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning, and then I will create recommendation models on more than 7 million user-item Amazon data entries.*
